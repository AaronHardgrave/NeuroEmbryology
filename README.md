# NeuroEmbryology: Interactive Neural Development Module

An interactive web-based learning module designed for first-year medical students to explore the embryological development of the nervous system. This module combines 3D anatomical models with clinical correlations and self-assessment questions to create a comprehensive, high-impact learning experience.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this module, students will be able to:
- Describe the key stages of neural tube formation and closure
- Explain the development of brain vesicles and their adult derivatives
- Understand ventricular system development and CSF circulation
- Recognize clinically-relevant congenital malformations and their embryological basis
- Apply developmental knowledge to clinical vignettes

## 🌟 Features

### Interactive 3D Models
- High-quality Sketchfab models from University of Dundee, CAHID
- Rotate, zoom, and explore anatomical structures at your own pace
- Visualize complex 3D relationships that are difficult to appreciate in textbooks

### Stage-by-Stage Timeline Navigation
- **Stage 1**: Neurulation (Weeks 3-4)
- **Stage 2**: Neural Tube Formation (Week 4)
- **Stage 3**: Brain Vesicle Formation (Weeks 4-5)
- **Stage 4**: Ventricular System Development (Weeks 5-8)

### Clinical Integration
- High-yield clinical correlations at each stage
- Real-world applications of embryological concepts
- Focus on USMLE Step 1-relevant malformations:
  - Neural tube defects (spina bifida, anencephaly)
  - Holoprosencephaly
  - Tethered cord syndrome
  - Congenital hydrocephalus (aqueductal stenosis, Dandy-Walker, Chiari II)

### Self-Assessment
- USMLE-style clinical vignettes with detailed explanations
- Interactive answer selection with immediate feedback
- Comprehensive rationales linking developmental concepts to clinical scenarios

### Student-Friendly Design
- Time estimates for each section (5-6 minutes per stage)
- Clean, distraction-free interface
- Mobile-responsive for studying on any device
- Progressive disclosure to prevent cognitive overload
